# Weapon-Detection-Using-TF-Object-Detection-API

This project was developed using article in [medium post](https://medium.com/@alaasinjab/detailed-tutorial-build-your-custom-real-time-object-detector-5ade1017fd2d).
In this project, Checkpoints are saved in google drive to save training steps from abrupt kernel failure on google colab. For video processing,ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_2 is used but depending on application requirements, other models can also be fine tuned.
